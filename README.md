### Mapping
A pipeline for mapping and post-mapping filtering using PALEOMIX BAM pipeline.

### Sample filtering
A pipeline designed to remove problematic samples prior to downstream analyses.

### Sites filtering
A pipeline designed to avoid biases from low-quality mapping sites.

### Genotype likelihood calculation
A pipeline designed to call genotype likelihood for output as BEAGLE;

### Genotype calling
A pipeline designed to call genotypes;
